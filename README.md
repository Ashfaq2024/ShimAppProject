Add the following:

trap for invalid input (along with erroneous input, as before)

implement a "save and print" feature
"save" will be implemented in the next Sprint
"print" will display a pop-up window listing the total weight and count of shims
afterward, the running total and count will be cleared on the main form

prevent user input in output fields

implement the help menu

Ensure the program meets the user’s needs and functions correctly. Give careful thought to the user experience in addition to the coding. The code should be developed following “professional programming practice” (readable, meaningful, etc).# ShimAppProject
